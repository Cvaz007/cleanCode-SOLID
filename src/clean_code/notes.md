# Technical debt
What it is, is the lack of quality in the code, which generates a debt that will have repercussions on future costs.

**Economic  costs.**	
- Time to perform maintenance.
- Time to refactor code.
- Time to understand the code.
- Additional time for code transfer.

**How do you pay the technical debt?**	
It is simply a process that aims to improve the code without altering its behavior in order to make it more understandable and tolerable to change.	
It's necessary to have automatic testing. 

# How to name variables?	
You must nominate  the variables with pronounceable and expressive names (normally in English) and depends on the programming language you should use camecase or use underscores.

# DRY - Don't repeat yourself
This principle is don't duplicate code, because this way you can reduce some test and special code.
